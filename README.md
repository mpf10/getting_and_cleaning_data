JHU Module 3: Getting and Cleaning Data project

The step by step procedure in creating the tidy.txt file is below:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

There are 30 people observed for 5 different activity in this data. The final data set, where we got the mean per activity and subject , should have 150 rows.
